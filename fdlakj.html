            <h3>Problem 1.1: Applications on Integration</h3>
            <p>Consider a graph of \( \sin x \) between 0 and \( \pi \). If the graph is revolved around the x-axis, what is the ratio between the moment of inertia around the y-axis and the mass of the surface (the graph is hollow, which means its mass is the mass of the surface only, also the surface is uniform).</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>For a solid of revolution generated around the x-axis, the moment of inertia are as follows:</p>
            \[
                I_X = rac{\pi 
ho}{2} \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^4 \, dx
            \]
            \[
                I_Y = rac{I_X}{2} + \pi 
ho \int_{x_0}^{x_f} x^2 f(x)^2 \, dx
            \]
            <p>Where \( 
ho \) is the density of the shape, \( f(x) \) is the function, \( I_X \) is the moment of inertia around the x-axis, and \( I_Y \) is the moment of inertia around the y-axis.</p>
            <p>Combining these two equations yields:</p>
            \[
                I_Y = rac{\pi 
ho}{4} \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^4 \, dx + \pi 
ho \int_{x_0}^{x_f} x^2 f(x)^2 \, dx = \pi 
ho \left[ rac{1}{4} \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^4 \, dx + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} x^2 f(x)^2 \, dx 
ight]
            \]
            <p>Now, we have to find the mass. Notice that the graph is hollow, which means that the mass is just that of the surface. Also, as it's uniform, it has a constant density. Then:</p>
            \[
                
ho = rac{m}{V} \implies m = 
ho V
            \]
            <p>Substituting the value of \( V \) as:</p>
            \[
                V = \pi \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^2 \, dx
            \]
            <p>Then, the mass of the shape is:</p>
            \[
                m = \pi 
ho \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^2 \, dx
            \]
            <p>Now, we just have to find the ratio between the moment of inertia and the mass:</p>
            \[
                rac{I_Y}{m} = rac{\pi 
ho \left[ rac{1}{4} \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^4 \, dx + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} x^2 f(x)^2 \, dx 
ight]}{\pi 
ho \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^2 \, dx}
            \]
            <p>Simplifying the expression and substituting with \( f(x) = \sin x \):</p>
            \[
                rac{I_Y}{m} = rac{rac{1}{4} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin^4 x \, dx + \int_{0}^{\pi} x^2 \sin^2 x \, dx}{\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin^2 x \, dx} \approx 2.977368134
            \]
            <p>Hence, the ratio between the moment of inertia around the y-axis and the mass is: \( I_Y : m = 2.977:1 \approx 3:1 \).</p>

            <h3>Problem 1.2: Volume of a Revolved Bottle</h3>
            <p>Mazen wants to make a new top cola bottle with a bigger volume, so he chooses the design of the bottle to be \( rac{1}{1+x} \) revolved around the y-axis from 0 to 4. What is the volume of the bottle?</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>To evaluate this problem, we can easily use the formula for the volume of rotation around the y-axis:</p>
            \[
                V = \pi \int_a^b r(y)^2 \, dy
            \]
            <p>However, we have to first find both the function and the boundaries in terms of \( y \).</p>
            \[
                y = rac{1}{1+x} \\
                rac{1}{y} = x + 1 \\
                x = rac{1-y}{y}
            \]
            <p>For the boundaries:</p>
            \[
                	ext{Lower boundary: } y = rac{1}{1+0} = 1 \\
                	ext{Upper boundary: } y = rac{1}{1+4} = rac{1}{5}
            \]
            <p>Since the lower boundary now is larger than the upper one, we will have to reverse them when evaluating the integral to get a positive volume. Now, evaluating the integral:</p>
            \[
                V = \pi \int_{rac{1}{5}}^1 \left( rac{1-y}{y} 
ight)^2 \, dy = \pi \int_{rac{1}{5}}^1 \left( 1 - rac{2}{y} + rac{1}{y^2} 
ight) \, dy
            \]
            <p>The first and third terms are easy to work with, just the second one involves a substitution:</p>
            \[
                \int rac{2}{y} \, dy = 2 \ln |y| + C
            \]
            <p>Then, the integral ends up as:</p>
            \[
                V = \pi \left[ y - 2 \ln |y| - rac{1}{y} 
ight]_{rac{1}{5}}^1 \approx 1.58112 \pi
            \]
            <p>Hence, the volume between 0 and 4 is: \( V \approx 1.58 \pi \approx 4.963 \).</p>

            <h3>Problem 1.3: Surface Area and Area Under Curve</h3>
            <p>If the function \( y = e^x \) is rotated around the x-axis, find the ratio between its surface area from 1 to 6 and the area under the curve of \( y \) from 0 to 5.</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>First, find the area under the curve of \( e^x \):</p>
            \[
                A = \int_0^5 e^x \, dx = e^5 - 1
            \]
            <p>Second, find the surface area of the rotated curve about the x-axis using the surface area formula:</p>
            \[
                S = 2\pi \int_1^6 e^x \sqrt{1+e^{2x}} \, dx
            \]
            <p>Evaluating this integral gives approximately 511301.7002. Now, find the ratio:</p>
            \[
                rac{S}{A} = rac{511301.7002}{e^5 - 1} \approx 3468.49
            \]
            <p>Hence, the ratio is: \( oxed{3468.49} \).</p>

        <div class="problem">
            <h3>Problem 1.4: Average Acceleration</h3>
            <p>If a force \( f(x) = \sin^3 x \) is applied on Mazen, find the average acceleration between 0 and \( rac{\pi}{2} \) if Mazen has a mass of 70 kg.</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>From Newton's second law, we know that force is equal to \( ma \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( a \) is the acceleration. Then:</p>
            \[
                a = rac{F}{m} \implies ar{a} = rac{ar{F}}{m}
            \]
            <p>We can use the formula for the average force:</p>
            \[
                ar{F} = rac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b F(x) \, dx
            \]
            <p>Substituting the values:</p>
            \[
                ar{F} = rac{1}{rac{\pi}{2} - 0} \int_0^{rac{\pi}{2}} \sin^3 x \, dx
            \]
            <p>Using the formula for the integration of sines:</p>
            \[
                \int \sin^n (x) \, dx = -rac{\sin^{n-1} (x) \cos (x)}{n} + rac{n-1}{n} \int \sin^{n-2} (x) \, dx
            \]
            <p>Applying this formula gives:</p>
            \[
                \int \sin^3 x = -rac{\sin^2 x \cos x}{3} - rac{2}{3} \cos x
            \]
            <p>Evaluating the boundaries:</p>
            \[
                \int_0^{rac{\pi}{2}} \sin^3 x = \left[ -rac{\sin^2(rac{\pi}{2}) \cos(rac{\pi}{2})}{3} - rac{2}{3} \cos(rac{\pi}{2}) 
ight] - \left[ -rac{\sin^2(0) \cos(0)}{3} - rac{2}{3} \cos(0) 
ight]
            \]
            <p>This evaluates to:</p>
            \[
                0 - \left( -rac{2}{3} 
ight) = rac{2}{3}
            \]
            <p>Then:</p>
            \[
                ar{F} = rac{2}{\pi} \cdot rac{2}{3} = rac{4}{3\pi}
            \]
            <p>Substituting this in the formula for the average acceleration:</p>
            \[
                ar{a} = rac{ar{F}}{m} = rac{rac{4}{3\pi}}{70} = rac{2}{105\pi}
            \]
            <p>Hence, the average acceleration is: \( ar{a} \approx 6.063 	imes 10^{-3} \).</p>

            <h3>Problem 1.5: Moment of Inertia of a Plant</h3>
            <p>Mazen saw a strange plant with the shape of \( f(x) = e^x \) revolved around the x-axis from 1 to 4. The plant's density increases with distance from the x-axis where \( 
ho = r \), where \( r \) is the distance from the x-axis. What is the moment of inertia of the plant around the y-axis?</p>
            <h4>Solution:</h4>
            <p>To solve this problem, recall the formula for the moment of inertia around the y-axis used in Problem 1.1:</p>
            \[
                I_Y = \pi \int_{x_0}^{x_f} x \, dx \left[ rac{1}{4} \int_{x_0}^{x_f} f(x)^4 \, dx + \int_{x_0}^{x_f} x^2 f(x)^2 \, dx 
ight]
            \]
            <p>Here, \( 
ho = r \) but it's variable, so we replace it by \( \int x \, dx \) instead:</p>
            \[
                I_Y = \pi \int_{1}^{4} x \, dx \left[ rac{1}{4} \int_{1}^{4} e^{4x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{4} x^2 e^{2x} \, dx 
ight] \approx 13524736.28
            \]
            <p>Hence, the moment of inertia of the plant around the y-axis is: \( I_Y = oxed{13524736.28} \).</p>
